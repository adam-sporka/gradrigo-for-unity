How to run Gradrigo for Unity
------------------------------

1. Add gradrigo.cs script as a component of some global object.

2. Add an Audio Source component to the same object.

3. The global object and other objects may call the following methods
   of the Gradrigo class:

   -- ParseString
   -- StartVoice
   -- ReleaseVoice
   -- StopVoice
   -- StopAllVoices
   -- SetVariable 

   Please check gradrigo.cs for more information on those methods.
   
   In general, you want to parse your Gradrigo script first.
   
   You then want to start a voice with a name of an existing box.
   (Note: Boxes are what FMOD Studio would call Events.) You may
   also provide parameters to this box instance. If a box instance
   misses a parameter, it will default it to zero. Parameters are
   presented in the 
   
   Sustained sound need to be released (i.e. natural stop) or stopped
   (abrupt stop). You may stop all voices at once, but this is usually
   done only during emergencies.
   
   SetVariable sets the global variables.
   

How to run Gradrigo for Unity in multi-instance mode
-----------------------------------------------------

gradrigo.cs script can be added to any number of game objects.
If any such object has also its Audio Source component, it will
be an independent Gradrigo instance host. Just set its Spatial
Blend to 3D and let Unity do its 3D audio magic! In any case,
please be mindful of the computational load.


Questions?

Please let me know if anything doesn't work the way you suppose to.
I'll do my best to fix that or the corresponding part of the documentation.
