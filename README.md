# Gradrigo Test Game

A Unity project demonstrating the use of Gradrigo as a SFX synthesizer in a game.
A clone of Arkanoid is used for this purpose.

It is also possible to attach multiple instances of Gradrigo to several game objects
and let Unity apply the 3D sound effects on those but that's not demonstrated
in this example.
